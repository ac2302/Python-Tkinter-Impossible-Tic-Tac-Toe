# Python-Tkinter-Impossible-Tic-Tac-Toe
This is a simple game of tic tac toe coded in python using the tkinter module. The logic was made entirely by me. it reci=ursively looks into all of the possible moves and selects the best possible move. I made this before learning the mini-max algorithm. all moves except the first move are made with help of the above method.

## How To Play
click empty spot to place mark or use the numpad. Every number key on the numpad maps to a spot in the grid.
result of match will be displayed in the title of the screen.
press any key after the game has ended to start a new game.
